# The most perfect `~/.bash_aliases` file

This is the list for the most usefull bash aliases and functions that can be used by web-developers and server administrators.
  
  All aliases were taken from a lot of web-sources and also created myself.

  Before downloading this file, make sure that you have file ~/.bash-aliases and code lines like this in your ~/.bashrc file.
    
    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
       . ~/.bash_aliases
    fi 
 
 To install this file into your bash profile, just use the code lines below (!! it will rewrite your own ~/.bash-aliases file !!):

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharmingProjects/bash_aliases/master/.bash_aliases -O ~/.bash_aliases && . ~/.bash_aliases
 
 This ~/.bash_aliases file is going to update from time to time!
