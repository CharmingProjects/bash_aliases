# The most perfect `~/.bash_aliases` file

This is the list for the most usefull bash aliases and functions that can be used by web-developers and server administrators.
  
  All aliases were taken from a lot of web-sources and also created myself.

  Before downloading this file, make sure that you have code lines like this in your ~/.bashrc file.
    
    if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
       . ~/.bash_aliases
    fi 
 
 To install this file into your bash profile, just use the code lines below (!! it will rewrite all your own aliases !!):
 ## Installation for CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
 
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharmingProjects/bash_aliases/master/.bash_aliases_rpm -O ~/.bash_aliases && . ~/.bash_aliases
 
 ## Installation for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
 
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CharmingProjects/bash_aliases/master/.bash_aliases_deb -O ~/.bash_aliases && . ~/.bash_aliases
 
 This ~/.bash_aliases file is going to update from time to time, so come over here sometimes!
